Commercialization Plan
======================

This section describes some options for commercialization and
technology transfer that are being considered for DIMS deliverable
products.

.. _intellectualProperty:

Intellectual Property
---------------------

Under the terms of the Contract, Section C.3.4, the products of this project
are to be released as open source under a selected open source license. As
described in Section :ref:`approvedLicense`, this license is the
Berkeley Three-Part license.

.. _technologytransfer:

Technology Transfer
-------------------

No intellectual property disclosures to the University of Washington will
result from this project. All technology transfer will result from uniform
public access to the released open source code and documentation.
That said, getting the open source products resulting from this contract to be
widely used will not be simple, or easy. As Maughan *et al* [MBLT13]_ discuss,
projects do not sell themselves and many attempts may be necessary (some
resulting in failure) before success is achieved.

Outreach activities, and collaboration attempts during the project to date have
shown that language, pictures, shared experience, and a clear description of
the problems and proposed solution are important (yet simultaneously a
challenge to achieve.) Still, the conversations we have had with multiple
organizations are promising.  Following sections list some of the organizations
that have been approached about using, continuing to develop, or promoting the
open source products resulting from this contract.


.. _csirtgadgets:

CSIRT Gadgets Foundation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conversations with Wes Young and Gabe Iovino of the `CSIRT Gadgets Foundation`_
indicate that their foundation may be a good place for forks of the DIMS code,
configuration, and documentation repositories to be housed and maintained
similarly to the way the `Collective Intelligence Framework`_ is maintained.
Additionally, there are opportunities working with the foundation to
enhance CIF using DIMS products and lessons learned.
This would be a natural place to take the techniques in system administration
automation, Docker containerization and CoreOS clustering, and continuous
integration of source components and system configuration.

.. _farsightsecurity:

Farsight Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Farsight Security has expressed an interest in supporting continued development
of DIMS components with letters of support and other political and social acts,
but desires to be a client in future collaborations rather than a volunteer
contributor.  Further conversations with Farsight may explore possible interest
in grants or contracts to provide financial support for further system
integration efforts.

Farsight has been very generous in making architectural changes to the new (and
soon-to-be publicly released ) **Trident** portal system that enable DIMS
component integration with Trident. The DIMS team has been working with
Farsight to facilitate red team application assessment that will help improve
Trident.


.. _piscesnw:

PISCES Northwest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A not-for-profit entity known as the Public Infrastructure Security
Collaboration and Exchange System (PISCES-NW, for "North West") was recently
formed. The Board of Directors is seeking grant funding to extend a
regional SLTT security monitoring project (formerly known as the Public
Regional Information Security Event Monitoring project, or "PRISEM").  Under
this proposal, the PI will be engaged for a limited time in the initial phase
as a sub-contractor, focused on assisting with implementation of selected DIMS
open source products as requested by PISCES-NW. One of the PISCES-NW project's
objectives is to integrate DHS S&T-funded research products, which fits in line
with values and objectives described in Sections :ref:`introduction`
and :ref:`valueproposition`.


.. _cri:

Cyber Resilience Institute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PI was invited to be on the Board of Directors of the Colorado-based
Cyber Resilience Institute (CRI). DIMS products will be demonstrated to
the CRI Board and considered for inclusion in pilot projects that
CRI is pursuing, possibly in collaboration with educational institutions
in the state of Colorado.

.. _other:

Other Security Companies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conversations have taken place with other "stealth-mode" computer security
companies, both in Washington state and elsewhere. Because of non-disclosure
agreements, they will not be directly named here. The discussions have involved
the possibility of using and contributing back to the DIMS open source code
products, using them to complement internally-developed commercial products
and services, and/or implementing custom deployments of DIMS+Trident
components for customers to use in forming and operating trusted information
sharing and security operations. Possible partnership between several of
these companies is on the table, which could greatly accelerate continued
development of products resulting from the DIMS contract.
