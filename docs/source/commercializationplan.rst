Commercialization Plan
======================

This section describes some options for commercialization and
technology transfer that are being considered for DIMS deliverable
products.

.. _grants:

Continued grant funding
-----------------------

A series of proposals are in submission and/or in preparation,
to DARPA, DHS, and/or NSF.

.. _darpaRadics:

DARPA
~~~~~

A proposal was submitted to **DARPA-BAA-16-14**
Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation and Characterization Systems (RADICS).
This proposal built upon DIMS as an easy to use trusted information sharing
and communication platform on which detective algorithms, data analytics,
and visualization capabilities can be supported to help deal with
attacks on ICS systems in the energy sector.

From the abstract of the UW electronic grants submission:

.. epigraph::

   Next Century Corporation, IronNet Cybersecurity, the University of Southern
   California Information Sciences Institute (USC ISI), University of
   Washington Tacoma (UW Tacoma), and University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas)
   propose the Cyber Understanding for Rapid Response to Electrical Network
   Threats (CURRENT) system for TA-1 of the DARPA Rapid Attack Detection,
   Isolation, and Characterization Systems (RADICS) program.

   We propose a software framework that provides early warning of cyber attack
   on components of the electrical grid, detection of electrical grid telemetry
   spoofing, and situation awareness in the post-attack environment based on a
   foundation provided by the Distributed Incident Management System (DIMS)
   platform, an innovative communications framework created by UW Tacoma and
   Next Century for sharing structured cyber threat information across sites
   developed under DHS contract HSHQDC-13-C-B0013 (UW Sage #A110893). DIMS will
   enable the exchange of indicators of compromise (IOCs) and other information
   between geographically separated grid interconnections to recover from cyber
   attacks affecting multiple components of a regional power grid. CURRENT uses
   this foundation for applying complementary techniques provided by other team
   members for spoofing detection, data collection from sensors in the field,
   evaluation of device trustworthiness, anomaly detection in power grid
   interconnections (e.g., power stations and substations, relays), and
   producing overall situational awareness to enable rapid response to attacks
   on the nationâ€™s power grid.

   Specifically, the project technical activities that UWT will be
   supporting are:

   1. Develop tools for sharing indicators of compromise and other cyber
      incident data among trusted parties in response to a cyber-attack on
      the power grid.
   2. Develop tools for collaborative evaluation of forensic evidence.
   3. Support customer meetings and field exercises.

Technology Transfer

.. _csirtgadgets:

CSIRT Gadgets Foundation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conversations with Wes Young and Gabe Iovino of the `CSIRT Gadgets Foundation`_
indicate that this may be a good place for a fork of the DIMS code to
be housed and maintained similarly to the way the `Collective Intelligence
Framework`_ is maintained. This would be a natural place to take the techniques
in system administration automation, Docker containerization and CoreOS
clustering, and continuous integration of source components and system
configuration.

.. _farsightsecurity:

Farsight Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Farsight Security has expressed an interest in supporting continued development
of DIMS components with letters of support and other political and social
acts, but desires to be a client in future collaborations rather than a
volunteer contributor. They have been very generous in making architectural
changes that help integrate DIMS components with the new (and soon-to-be
publicly released **Trident** portal system) and appreciate the
upcoming application penetration test by Leviathan Security.

The PI will hold further conversations with Farsight to explore
possible interest in grants or contracts to provide financial
support for any further system integration efforts.

.. _ci:

Critical Informatics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Critical Informatics (CI) business model is complementary to the feature
set of DIMS. The PI and the principal co-founder of CI (Mike Hamilton) have
worked together on the concepts for regional collaborative incident response
under various forms of DHS funding going back to 2008.
