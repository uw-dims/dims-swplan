Commercialization Plan
======================

This section describes some options for commercialization and
technology transfer that are being considered for DIMS deliverable
products.

.. _intellectualProperty:

Under the terms of the Contract, Section C.3.4, the products of this project
are to be released as open source under a selected open source license. As
described in Section :ref:`approvedLicense`, this license is the
Berkeley Three-Part license.

.. _technologytransfer:

Technology Transfer
-------------------

No intellectual property disclosures will result from this project. All
technology tranfer will result from uniform access to the released
open source code and documentation.

.. _csirtgadgets:

CSIRT Gadgets Foundation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conversations with Wes Young and Gabe Iovino of the `CSIRT Gadgets Foundation`_
indicate that their foundation may be a good place for forks of the DIMS code,
configruation, and documentation repositories to be housed and maintained
similarly to the way the `Collective Intelligence Framework`_ is maintained.
This would be a natural place to take the techniques in system administration
automation, Docker containerization and CoreOS clustering, and continuous
integration of source components and system configuration.

.. _farsightsecurity:

Farsight Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Farsight Security has expressed an interest in supporting continued development
of DIMS components with letters of support and other political and social acts,
but desires to be a client in future collaborations rather than a volunteer
contributor. They have been very generous in making architectural changes that
help integrate DIMS components with the new (and soon-to-be publicly released
**Trident** portal system) and appreciate feedback from red teaming done in
conjunction with this project.

Further conversations with Farsight will explore possible interest in grants or
contracts to provide financial support for any further system integration
efforts.


.. _ci:

Critical Informatics and PISCES Northwest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Critical Informatics (CI) business model is complementary to the feature
set of DIMS. The PI and the principal co-founder of CI (Mike Hamilton) have
worked together on the concepts for regional collaborative incident response
under various forms of DHS funding going back to 2008.

Critical Informatics will be supporting the newly-formed not-for-profit
entity known as the Public Infrastructure Security Collaboration
and Exchange System (PISCES-NW, for "North West").

The PI will be engaged for a limited period of time, focused on technology
transfer activities in terms of assistance in implementing the DIMS open source
products for PISCES-NW.


.. _cri:

Cyber Resilience Institute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PI was invited to be on the Board of Directors of the Colorado-based
Cyber Resilience Institute (CRI).
