Introduction
============

Value of the Project
--------------------

As described in the :ref:`dimsocd:dimsoperationalconceptdescription` document,
the DIMS project has two primary expected outcomes: (1) an example platform for
building a complex integrated open source system for computer security incident
response, and (2) to transition this platform into the public sector to
support operational needs of State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal (SLTT)
government entities. The latest modification to the contract includes a
pilot deployment for use by the United States Secret Service in addition to
the release of open source code and documentation.

The value of this project results from the products (both tangible and
intangible) developed over the course of the period of performance. The team
created and used a continuous integration/continuous delivery model for taking
software source code, system automation instructions and software
configuration, as well as documentation, to build a prototype for an open
source software integration project, or for use by an internal security
operations group (or managed security service provider) to create an open
source incident response capability.

Expected Outcomes
-----------------

The primary outcome of the DIMS project is the publication of open source
tools and documentation, following implementation of the components in
a prototype deployment. A pilot deployment for the United States Secret
Service to use for their Electronic Crimes Task Force (ECTF) program
is also an outcome of this project. Another deployment of selecte
DIMS products will be initiated for the PISCES-NW not-for-profit
organization (see Section :ref:`piscesnw`).


.. _impacts:

Impacts
-------

The impact of the effort expended in this project goes beyond just implementing
one instance of a set of open source service components for a single group. The
model that was established can be replicated widely and improved upon by others
faced with the same set of challenges in developing an affordable and scalable
incident response capability. Over the course of the project, we have learned
of several other efforts to address a similar set of goals and have reached out
(as much as time permits) to find common ground and try to develop
collaborative relationships that will have broad impact over time.


.. _theproduct:

The Product
-----------

The open source code and documentation produced during the life of this project
are the primary product. They document the lessons learned, provide an
instructional path to follow, a guide for how to continue moving forward, and
illuminate the foundation we have established.  With those components and
instructions, the foundation for creating an operational capability supporting
several fundamental incident response use cases can be set up in less time and
effort. If widely used, many of the unfinished features and bugs can be
addressed by a larger number of people than could be supported by the DIMS
contract.

Getting the open source products from this contract to be widely used will not
be simple, or easy. As Maughan et al [MBLT13]_ discuss, projects do not sell
themselves and many attempts may be necessary (some resulting in failure)
before success is achieved. Outreach activities, and collaboration attempts
during the project to date have shown that language, pictures, shared
experience, and a clear description of the problems and proposed solution are
important (yet simultaneously a challenge to achieve.)

.. _theproblem:

The Problem it Solves
---------------------

The fundamental problem that this project aims to solve is to to bring
capabilities of multiple open source products into a functioning whole. This is
acheived by assembling all of the necessary components and instructions for
building a distributed system with software development and operations
("DevOps") features that support a modern software development and system
integration team.

One outcome of solving this problem is creating a model platform (or
DevOps infrastructure) that can facilitate the secure integration of
open source compronents that (in and of themselves) are often hard to
deploy, and many times so insecurely implemented that they are effectively
wide open to the internet.

Open source software makes up the foundation of the internet as we know it
today. OpenSSH, OpenSSL, NTP, and GnuPG are examples of successful open source
software used in many products, both open source and commercial.
Vulnerabilities like Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) have served as a wake-up call
for the need to improve the development and maintenance processes of these open
source projects to create a more secure foundation. The Linux Foundation began
`The Core Infrastructure Initiative`_, with the stated goal to "speed the pace
of open-source innovation while dramatically reducing global threats to online
security." The Criteria for software development in the Best Practices Badge
program GitHub page are rich, focusing primarily on software production. Where
they touch on aspects of the development environment and systems
administration, they provide less detail. The sections `Security of the development environment`_
and `Deployment and operations`_ are short, general,
and do not share the same depth of specificity and guidance. The links to
the `GitHub security policy`_ and `Heroku security policy`_ provide a longer list of tasks, but
neither of these references goes deep enough to guide an open source software
development team in setting up and administering their own infrastructure.
These are policy documents that say *what to do*, but not *how to do it*. There are
detailed examples in the larger Criteria document, and links to working code to
be used in development, but not working configurations or specific steps for
setting up the development environment.

Benefits
--------

The benefit to those who chose to follow will be a faster and smoother journey
than we experienced during the DIMS project period of performance, since all of
the hurdles, mistakes, struggles, and ultimately the many successes and
achievements in distributed system engineering that were not easily found in
the open source community. The requirements document security practices and
features that we have attempted to incorporate to the greatest extent possible,
in a way that can be improved over time in a modular way. The system automation
and continuous integration/continuous deployment features help in implementing
and maintaining a secure system. (Red team application penetration testing will
further improve the security of the system through feedback about weaknesses
and deficiencies that crept in during development and deployment.)
